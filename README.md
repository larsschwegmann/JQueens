JQueens
=======

Description
-----------
Solves the popular '8-Queens' or 'N-Queens' problem by utilizing recursive backtraking.
Described more easily, this application bruteforces all methods possible.
This picture is a visual explanation of what JQueens does:

Although recursive action drain much memory and keep the CPU busy very long, it is still the most effective method to solve this problem.
The idea behind this came from the german Wikipedia Site, which describes the Bruteforcing method with a Python application: http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damenproblem#Rekursives_Backtracking

Interface
---------
As you can see on the picture below, JQueens is just a plain console application. A one stands for a set queen, a zero stands for an empty field.<br />

Building
--------
I've built JQueens using NetBeans and the latest JDK so you should too!
NetBeans is available for free here: http://netbeans.org/
Of course, you can build without NetBeans, but you need at least JDK 1.5 to compile!
